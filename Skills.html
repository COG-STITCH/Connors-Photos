<h1>A bit more about Connor</h1>
		<p>Connor along with being a big fan of photography he is also a keen soccer player, he never thinks all that highly of his skills after only scoring three goals after his first season. Connor plays for the Bathurst local team Panorama (carn the Goats) although he has only played juniors in 2020 he has ambitions to make his men’s grade debut and pursue a local career playing for his club Panorama, they aren’t the most loved club but they love their players. 
		Along with playing soccer religiously, Connor works at Kelso McDonalds, he doesn’t always love his job but he understands the use in having it, Connor loves a large majority of people he works with and that does make it a bit better.
		Connor tries to find meaning in his pictures, but most of the time there really isn’t any, Connor has loved taking pictures for so long and he hopes that excitement lasts for a long time.
