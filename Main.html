		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		
		<p>Connor Hart was born on the 10th of February, 2004. Starting his life in Sydney, he later moved to Bathurst where he continued his schooling at Kelso High Campus. It was at Kelso where he found his passion for Photography, he made it one of the most important subjects he took, prioritizing it over a lot of more educationally important subjects. Connor always loved to take photos, he thought that at any moment can be used for a photo, for class work instead of setting his work up a lot he tended to take random pictures of his friends and be able to capture the unspoken meaning in them. Connor received a lot of work from his teacher Mr Taylor, he was always there to be able to teach Connor something new on photoshop.</p>
